# Weather App using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

Welcome to the Weather App! üå§Ô∏è Building a dynamic Weather App for your website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Follow the detailed steps below to create an interactive app that fetches and displays real-time weather information.

## Introduction
In this project, we will leverage the OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve current weather data and present it on our website. The application will showcase key information such as Temperature, Weather Condition, Humidity, and Wind Speed for a user-specified city.

## Prerequisites
- Basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- An API key from [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/) (a free tier is available).

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/weather-app.git
Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd weather-app

## Steps
Open index.html in your preferred web browser or set up a local server.
Fetching Weather Data
Obtain your API key from OpenWeatherMap.
Open script.js and replace 'YOUR_API_KEY' with your actual API key.
Implement the logic to fetch weather data using JavaScript's fetch API.
Displaying Weather Information
Design the HTML structure to hold weather information.
Style the elements using CSS to create an appealing layout.
Use JavaScript to dynamically update the UI with fetched weather data.
User Interaction
Implement a search box where users can input the city name.
Add event listeners to trigger weather data retrieval based on user input.
